# SUPERVISOR-AND-SALES-DATA-DASHBOARD-YEAR-2020-2022
The dashboard categorizes sales by supervisor names: Aadil Khan, Aarvi Gupta, Advika Joshi, Ajay..., Roshan..., and Vijay Singh.
# Sales Performance by Category
The dashboard breaks down sales into categories like NIC (presumably Network Interface Card), Monitor, Mouse, CPU, Graphic Card, Keyboard, Cabinet, HDD, SSD, RAM, Motherboard, Computer Case, and Printer.
It showcases total sales figures, but not unit sales. This makes it difficult to pinpoint the most popular category by volume.
However, based on total sales, Monitors appear to be the top-selling category, followed by HDDs and SSDs.
# Sales Profitability by State
The dashboard groups sales by state: ISTA, NISTAN, TAJIKIST, FGHANISTAN, CHINA, PAKISTAN, MYANMAR, Arabian Sea, THAILAND, and MALAYSIA.
It displays total sales by state, but lacks profit margin data. This makes it impossible to definitively identify the most profitable state.
That being said, THAILAND appears to have the highest total sales, followed by MALAYSIA and ISTA.
# Sales Profitability by Brand
The dashboard categorizes sales by brands including Intel, Samsung, Dell, Nvidia, Western Digital, Acer, Gigabyte, Hynix, Seagate, and Morosoft Corporation. ContrastMar.
Similar to states, it shows total sales by brand but omits profit margin data. Therefore, it's difficult to determine the most profitable brands.
However, Intel seems to lead in total sales, followed by Samsung and Dell.
Overall Insights
While the dashboard offers a breakdown of sales by supervisor, category, state, and brand, it lacks crucial data points like unit sales and profit margins for each category, state, and brand.
This makes it challenging to glean comprehensive insights into sales performance and profitability.
# For a more professional and detailed analysis, the dashboard would benefit from including the following:
Unit Sales: Including unit sales alongside total sales would provide a clearer picture of the most popular categories (by volume) and potentially reveal buying trends.
Profit Margins: Incorporating profit margin data for each category, state, and brand would be essential to identify the most profitable aspects of the business.
Year-over-Year Comparisons: Highlighting year-over-year comparisons would reveal sales trends and growth patterns.
